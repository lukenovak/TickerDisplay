# TickerDisplay
A chrome extension that displays daily change in price for stocks in post

Currently Under Development
- Uses the IEX API, more info can be found at https://iextrading.com/developer/

For now, the extension only recognizes symbols after a dollar sign

Future features:
- Tracking how a post has done (i.e. Showing change since the post was made, not just the daily change)
- Prettier popup
